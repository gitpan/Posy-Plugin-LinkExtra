==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::LinkExtra - Posy plugin to add extras to local links


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::LinkExtra.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin uses information from the Posy::Plugin::FileStats plugin to add
extra information to flagged relative links that link to files in the data
directory.

For any link to a file, add the extra attribute 'posy_link' with the
arguments for what extras you want for this link.

For example:

<a href="thingie.jpg" posy_link="size">my thingie</a>

will give

<a href="thingie.jpg">my thingie</a> (4K)

The 'posy_link' attribute must be the last attribute in the link (to make it
easier to parse).

Options:

size
The size of the linked-to file, as "(size)" in K or M or bytes, depending on
how large the file is.

words
The number of words in the linked-to file (as given by the FileStats
plugin).

mod
The last-modified date of the linked-to file.

This plugin creates a 'link_extra' entry action, which should be placed
after 'parse_entry' in the entry_action list. If you are using the
Posy::Plugin::ShortBody plugin, this should be placed after 'short_body' in
the entry_action list, not before it.
